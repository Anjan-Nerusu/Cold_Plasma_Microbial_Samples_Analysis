# Cold_Plasma_Microbial_Samples_Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing the microbial inactivation process induced by cold plasma treatment. The analysis involves calculating the average reduction for each time point across different frequencies, along with the standard deviation. The data is visualized using plots and calculated error bars.
