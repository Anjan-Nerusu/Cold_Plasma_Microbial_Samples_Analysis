# Cold Plasma Microbial Inactivation Kinetics

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the microbial inactivation process induced by cold plasma treatment. Cold plasma has gained attention as a non-thermal method for microbial inactivation, offering an environmentally friendly and efficient alternative to conventional sterilization methods. The primary goal of this study is to understand how various parameters, including plasma exposure time and frequency, influence the reduction of microbial populations.

## Key Objectives

- **Investigate microbial inactivation kinetics**: The project analyzes the reduction in microbial population after exposure to cold plasma at different frequencies (500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 1500 Hz, 2000 Hz, 2500 Hz). It explores how the frequency of plasma affects the efficiency of microbial inactivation over time.

- **Evaluate average reduction across multiple trials**: The data includes measurements of microbial reduction over several trials, considering multiple frequency treatments. The reduction values are calculated for different time intervals to understand the dynamic response of microorganisms to plasma exposure.

- **Measure standard deviation and variability**: The standard deviation for the reduction values across different time points and frequencies provides insight into the consistency of microbial inactivation under the given experimental conditions.

- **Model and visualize microbial inactivation kinetics**: Statistical analysis is applied to evaluate the trend of microbial inactivation over time, and visualization techniques such as line plots and error bars are used to assess the relationship between time, frequency, and inactivation efficiency.

## Data Structure

- **Frequency (Hz)**: The plasma frequency used in the treatment (500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500 Hz).

- **Time_in_minutes**: The time duration for plasma exposure, ranging from 0 to 6 minutes.

- **Reduction1, Reduction2, Reduction3**: The microbial reduction observed in three separate trials.

- **Standard_deviation**: The standard deviation of reduction values across the three trials, providing insight into the variability of results.

- **Reductions_average**: The average reduction calculated from the three trials for each frequency and time point.

## Analysis Approach

The analysis involves calculating the average reduction for each time point across different frequencies, along with the standard deviation. The data is visualized using line plots to show the relationship between time and reduction for each frequency. Error bars representing the standard deviation are included to demonstrate the variability across the trials.

Additionally, the kinetics of microbial inactivation are modeled by fitting the reduction data to appropriate mathematical models to predict the effectiveness of cold plasma at various frequencies and exposure times.

## Expected Outcomes

The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how cold plasma frequencies affect microbial inactivation kinetics. This knowledge will contribute valuable data that can inform practical applications in sterilization, food preservation, and other industries where microbial control is critical.
